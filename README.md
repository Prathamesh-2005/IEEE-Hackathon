#IEEE-Hackathon 2024
Introduction Welcome to CurrencyTracker Insights, a cutting-edge project developed for the Northern Trust Hackathon. This ambitious undertaking combines the power of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for frontend and backend development with Python for robust data processing, utilizing libraries such as Pandas. The focus of this project is to provide graphical visualizations of currency tracking, specifically in relation to the US Dollar, spanning the years 2012 to 2022.

Project Vision CurrencyTracker Insights aims to offer a comprehensive view of currency fluctuations, providing users with valuable insights into historical trends and patterns. By integrating the MERN stack with Python's Pandas library, we seek to create an interactive and user-friendly platform that not only presents data visually but also enables users to analyze and interpret currency movements over the past decade.
